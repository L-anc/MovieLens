# MovieLens

In late 2006, Netflix challenged the world to create a recommender system that could predict whether a
user would like a given movie based on his/her previous ratings on other movies. Netflix created their
own recommender system, Cinematch, and hoped that the world could beat their performance by over
10% (in terms of how closely predicted ratings match subsequent actual ratings). The challenge ended in
September 2009, when team ”BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos” surpassed the 10% mark.
In this miniproject, we will focus on creating visualizations of this data, rather than predicting user ratings
on movies. In order to reduce the computational time needed to produce these visualizations, we will be
working with the smaller MovieLens Dataset rather than the full Netflix Prize Dataset. We will start with
some basic visualizations and then move on to more complicated ones.
